# Code of Conduct

Nothing is more precious to me than my First Amendment rights, and I hope the same is true for you. If so, **conduct** yourself accordingly, and say whatever the fuck you like. If not, feel free to **conduct** yourself right the fuck out of here.

## I mean it!

...It's **rebel** web tokens. You think I'm going to bow to the man, here?
